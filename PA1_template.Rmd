This is an R Markdown document of the 1st Peer Assessment in the Reproducible Research course in the Data Science Specialization.

The data used in this assignment comes from activity of an individual monitored using devices such as a FitBit, FuelBand, or Jawbone Up.


We first read the CSV and input the data into a data frame called "activity"
```{r, echo = TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

We can calculate the mean total of number of steps taken per day by doing this:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data <- activity[complete.cases(activity),]
stepsbydate <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum)
hist(stepsbydate)
```

The mean and the median of the steps are as follows:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(stepsbydate, na.rm = TRUE)
median(stepsbydate, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The plot of the steps by interval
```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(x = names(stepsbyinterval), y = stepsbyinterval, type = "l")
```
From this plot, we can see that the 835th 5 minute interval has the highest value at 10,927 steps.


The number of unobservable rows are:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```
